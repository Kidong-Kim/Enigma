# Enigma - Data Structiures and OOP

## Abstract

- The [Enigma encryption device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) in Java. [Project for CS61B](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/materials/proj/proj1/) - "Data Structures" at UC Berkeley during Spring 2020.
- The code is based on skeleton code from the class. Project was completed using the IntelliJ Java IDE. This submission received full score.
- Worked mostly with Java's String, HashMap, ArrayList, and Scanner data structures to handle string manipulation, data mapping required, and file reading for encryption.

## Project description

Replicated the WWII German encryption machine "Enigma" by building generalized simulator that could handle numerous different descriptions of possible initial configurations of the machine and messages to encode or decode.

Program uses settings and text from the left and cyphers or decyphers into text on the right.
